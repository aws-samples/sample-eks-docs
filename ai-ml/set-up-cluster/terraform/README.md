# ML on EKS - cluster setup (Terraform)

Terraform for the cluster used in [ML on EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ml-on-eks.html).
Two variants are provided; pick one:

- `auto-mode/` - EKS Auto Mode manages the compute.
- `karpenter/` - self-managed Karpenter manages the compute.

Each builds the same thing: a VPC, an EKS cluster, GPU NodePools for inference, and the
monitoring stack (Amazon Managed Prometheus, DCGM exporter, Grafana).

## Defaults

The cluster is named `ai-eks-docs` and lands in `us-east-2`. **Leave these as-is** so the
copy/paste commands in the user guide keep working.

## Deploy

```bash
cd auto-mode   # or: cd karpenter
terraform init
terraform apply
```

When it finishes, configure `kubectl` (the same command regardless of variant, since the cluster
name and region are fixed):

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-2 --name ai-eks-docs --alias ai-eks-docs
```

The outputs also include the node IAM role name and the model S3 bucket.

## GPU NodePools

`var.nodepools` selects the GPU inference strategy. It defaults to `dynamic-spot-on-demand`, so a
plain `terraform apply` needs no extra flags. The three strategies are mutually exclusive (each is a
complete solution for the inference workload); enable at most one.

| Strategy                           | What you get                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dynamic-spot-on-demand` (default) | On-demand GPU pool, spot-first with on-demand overflow. No reservation.                                   |
| `reserved-capacity-spot-overflow`  | Reserved GPU pool backed by an ODCR, with spot/on-demand overflow.                                        |
| `static-capacity-dynamic-overflow` | Always-on reserved pool (replicas = reserved instance count) plus a dynamic spot/on-demand overflow pool. |

### Reserved capacity

The reserved strategies need a `reservation`. Terraform creates the
On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR) for you - you do not supply a reservation ID. The ODCR is
tagged `nodepool=<strategy>` and the NodeClass selects it by that tag.

Use defaults (`g6e.4xlarge`, 1 instance, first cluster AZ):

```bash
terraform apply -var 'nodepools={"reserved-capacity-spot-overflow"={reservation={}}}'
```

Pick the instance type, count, and AZ:

```bash
terraform apply -var 'nodepools={"reserved-capacity-spot-overflow"={reservation={instance_type="g6e.4xlarge",instance_count=3,az="us-east-2a"}}}'
```

Always-on static pool (3 reserved instances) with dynamic overflow:

```bash
terraform apply -var 'nodepools={"static-capacity-dynamic-overflow"={reservation={instance_type="g6e.xlarge",instance_count=3}}}'
```

Notes:

- An ODCR **bills as soon as it is created** and keeps billing until destroyed, whether or not
  nodes are running on it.
- The reservation is a single block in **one AZ**. EC2 reserves all of `instance_count` in that AZ
  or fails with `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` - there is no automatic AZ fallback. If creation
  fails, set `reservation.az` to another AZ and re-apply.

## Clean up

To stop GPU charges while keeping the cluster running, drop the reservation by applying back to the
default. This destroys the ODCR and its reserved nodes; the cluster and monitoring stack stay up:

```bash
terraform apply
```

To delete everything this stack created (cluster, VPC, monitoring, any ODCR):

```bash
terraform destroy
```
